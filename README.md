# Smart Grid Load Monitoring and Forecasting

This project is a machine learning-based system for **real-time monitoring and forecasting of electrical load** using smart grid data.

## 🔍 Features

- Time series forecasting using ML (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network)
- Real-time load visualization (via Streamlit or Dash)
- Anomaly detection on forecast errors
- SHAP explainability for model transparency

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- SHAP for interpretability
- Streamlit or Dash for GUI
- joblib for model serialization

## 🧠 Models

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Neural Network (optional)

## 🚀 How to Run (Streamlit)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## ⚠️ Dataset

Make sure the dataset file `smart_grid_dataset.csv` is placed in the root folder.

## 🧪 Outputs

- Forecast plots
- Anomaly alerts
- SHAP summary and local explanations
